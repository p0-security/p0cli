## About

P0 manages just-in-time access to your cloud resources. The P0 CLI enables developers to seamlessly integrate P0 into their normal workflows by supporting the following use cases:

- Assume an AWS role or SSH into an AWS instance: P0 will request access, wait for access to be approved and provisioned, and then execute the relevant `aws` command
- Create P0 access requests for any cloud resource

To learn more about P0, see our [docs](https://docs.p0.dev/).

## Quickstart

### Installation

To install the P0 CLI, ensure your `node` version is 20 or higher, then run:

```
npm install -g @p0security/cli
```

You can now invoke the CLI by running `p0`.

If your node version is incompatible, use `nvm`. E.g.:

```
nvm install 20.14.0
nvm use 20.14.0
```

### Configuration

Before you can make requests using the P0 CLI, you will need to authenticate with your P0 organization. If you don't have a P0 organization account yet, follow our [Quick Start guide](https://docs.p0.dev/getting-started/quick-start) to create an account and install a resource for access requests.

Once you have a P0 organization account, run

```
p0 login <P0_ORGANIZATION_ID>
```

then follow the prompts in your browser to complete authentication.

You can now request access via

```
p0 request
```

## CLI Reference

### Usage

Interact with the `p0` CLI via:

```
p0 <command> <options>
```

To view help, use the `--help` option with any command.

### Available commands

```
  p0 aws                    Execute AWS commands
  p0 login <org>            Log in to p0 using a web browser
  p0 ls [arguments..]       List request-command arguments
  p0 request [arguments..]  Manually request permissions on a resource
  p0 ssh <destination>         SSH into a virtual machine
```

## Example Usage

### Create an access request

To view the resources available for access requests, run:

```
p0 request --help
```

Sample output:

```
Request access to a resource using P0

Commands:
  p0 request aws                Amazon Web Services
  p0 request azure-ad           Entra ID
  p0 request gcloud             Google Cloud
  p0 request okta               Okta
  p0 request ssh <destination>  Secure Shell (SSH) session
  p0 request workspace          Google Workspace

Options:
      --help    Show help                                              [boolean]
      --reason  Reason access is needed                                 [string]
  -w, --wait    Block until the request is completed                   [boolean]
```

Run `--help` on any of these commands for information on requesting that resource. For example, to request a Google Cloud role, run

```
p0 request gcloud --help
```

```
Google Cloud

Commands:
  p0 request gcloud resource <accesses..>  GCP resource
  p0 request gcloud role <names..>         Custom or predefined role
  p0 request gcloud permission <names..>   GCP permissions

Options:
      --help    Show help                                              [boolean]
      --reason  Reason access is needed                                 [string]
  -w, --wait    Block until the request is completed                   [boolean]
```

If you don't know the name of the role you need, you can use the `p0 ls` command. `p0 ls` accepts the same arguments that you provide to `p0 request` and lists the available options for access within your selected resource. For example, to view the available Google Cloud roles, run

```
 p0 ls gcloud role names --like bigquery
```

Now, to request `bigquery.admin`, run:

```
p0 request gcloud role bigquery.admin
```

This will create an access request on Slack. Once your access request is approved, you will automatically get access to the Bigquery Admin role.

### Assume an AWS IAM Role

You can use the P0 CLI to assume a role in AWS.

To use this feature, you will need to have installed and configured the AWS CLI. If you have not done so already, you can follow the [installation steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

List the roles that you have permissions to assume via:

```
p0 aws role ls
```

If you don't see your desired role, you will first need to request access to it. You can do that with `p0 request aws role <ROLE_NAME>`.

Once you have permissions, you can run

```
$(p0 aws role assume <ROLE_NAME>)
```

### SSH into an AWS Instance

You can request access to an AWS instance and open a SSH session once access is provisioned with a single command in the P0 CLI.

To use this feature, you will need to have installed and configured the AWS CLI and the Session Manager plugin. If you have not done so already, you can follow the [AWS CLI installation steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and [Session Manager plugin installation step](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html).

To see the available AWS instances, run:

```
p0 ls ssh destination
```

You can start a SSH session with:

```
p0 ssh <INSTANCE_NAME>
```

If you already have access, this will directly open the SSH session. Otherwise, it will request access, wait for approval, and open a SSH session once the access is provisioned.
