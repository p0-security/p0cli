## About

P0 manages just-in-time access to your cloud resources. The P0 CLI enables developers to seamlessly integrate P0 into their normal workflows by supporting the following use cases:

- Assume an AWS role or SSH into an AWS instance: P0 will request access, wait for access to be approved and provisioned, and then execute the relevant `aws` command
- Create P0 access requests for any cloud resource

To learn more about P0, see our [docs](https://docs.p0.dev/).

## Quickstart

### Installation

To install the P0 CLI, run:

```
npm install -g @p0security/p0cli
```

You can now invoke the CLI by running `p0`.

### Configuration

Before you can make requests using the P0 CLI, you will need to authenticate with your P0 organization. If you don't have a P0 organization account yet, follow our [Quick Start guide](https://docs.p0.dev/getting-started/quick-start) to create an account and install a resource for access requests.

Once you have a P0 organization account, run

```
p0 login <P0_ORGANIZATION_ID>
```

then follow the prompts in your browser to complete authentication.

You can now request access via

```
p0 request
```
