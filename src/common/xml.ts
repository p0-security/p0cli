/** A janky XML document -> POJS parser
 *
 * The document is treated as an XML element, then transformed
 * recursively via the following rules:
 *
 * If the element has child elements, it is converted to an object
 * with a property for each unique child element name, with
 * the property value equal to:
 * - The child element's transformed value, if there is only
 *   one element with the property name
 * - An array of transformed elements, if there are multiple
 *   child elements with the property name
 *
 * In addition, when the element has children, it receives an
 * additional `_attributes` property, which is an object of the
 * element's attributes.
 *
 * Otherwise, the element is transformed into the element's XML
 * text.
