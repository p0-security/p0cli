 * A SpanExporter that buffers spans in memory until a delegate exporter is available.
 *
 * This is useful when trace spans are created before authentication
 * and the actual exporter (e.g., OTLP exporter with access token)
 * can only be initialized after login.
 *
 * Spans exported before the delegate is set are stored in an internal buffer.
 * Once the delegate exporter is injected via `setDelegateAndExport()`,
 * all buffered spans are flushed to the delegate. Future spans are exported directly.
