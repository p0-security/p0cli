 * There are 7 cases of unprovisioned access in Google Cloud.
 * These are all potentially subject to propagation delays.
 * 1. The linux user name is not present in the user's Google Workspace profile `posixAccounts` attribute
 * 2. The public key is not present in the user's Google Workspace profile `sshPublicKeys` attribute
 * 3. The user cannot act as the service account of the compute instance
 * 4. The user cannot tunnel through the IAP tunnel to the instance
 * 5. The user doesn't have osLogin or osAdminLogin role to the instance
 * 5.a. compute.instances.get permission is missing
 * 5.b. compute.instances.osLogin permission is missing
 * 6. compute.instances.osAdminLogin is not provisioned but compute.instances.osLogin is - happens when a user upgrades existing access to sudo
 * 7: Rare occurrence, the exact conditions so far undetermined (together with CONNECTION_CLOSED_MESSAGE)
 *
 * 1, 2, 3 (yes!), 5b: result in PUBLIC_KEY_DENIED_MESSAGE
 * 4: results in UNAUTHORIZED_TUNNEL_USER_MESSAGE and also CONNECTION_CLOSED_MESSAGE
 * 5a: results in UNAUTHORIZED_INSTANCES_GET_MESSAGE
 * 6: results in SUDO_MESSAGE
 * 7: results in DESTINATION_READ_ERROR and also CONNECTION_CLOSED_MESSAGE
