/**
 * Parses out Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) from AWS into their components. Note
 * that not all components are present in all ARNs (depending on the service;
 * for example, S3 ARNs don't have a region or account ID), and the final
 * component of the ARN (`resource`) may contain its own internal structure that
 * is also service-dependent and which may also include colons. In particular,
 * quoting the Amazon docs: "Be aware that the ARNs for some resources omit the
 * Region, the account ID, or both the Region and the account ID."
 *
 * @param arn The ARN to parse as a string.
 * @return A structure representing the components of the ARN. All fields will
 * be defined, but some may be empty strings if they are not present in the ARN.
